Overview
----------
Structured latent attribute models (SLAMs) are a special family of discrete latent variable models widely used in social and biological sciences. This paper considers the problem of learning significant attribute patterns from a SLAM with potentially high-dimensional configurations of the latent attributes. We address the theoretical identifiability issue, propose a penalized likelihood method for the selection of the attribute patterns, and further establish the selection consistency in such an overfitted SLAM with a diverging number of latent patterns. The good performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated by simulation studies and two real datasets in educational assessments.

**slamR** works for 

* one-level binary responses
	-  known Q, unknown attribute set
    -  unknown Q, unknown attribute set
* two-level binary responses
	-  unknown or known Q, unknown attribute sets at both levels

Examples (two-level binary responses)
---------

- 1. restricted latent class analysis with **pre-specified # of factors** but unknown # of clusters
